# Bachelor-Thesis-Project
In this thesis, we investigated the different similarity search techniques of big data in data lakes and different big data frameworks while introducing how these similarity techniques can be used in this new paralyzed big data environment. However, very few papers were found discussing the reimplementation of early pruning algorithms, such as the DS-Prox algorithm introduced by Alserafi et al. (2017) in big data frameworks. This thesis’s goal is to provide a framework for entities aiming to scale different document similarity algorithms in big data frameworks such as Spark. This research aims to answer the research question which is “How can we scale up the DS-Prox algorithm to be used in big data frameworks such as Spark and whether the use of ensemble learners and Neural Network algorithms would achieve better results?”
